# Change sizing and descriptions

How big a change may get before it has to be split, the four splitting
strategies, and what the description has to say. Open this file when the diff
looks large or when you are writing the message that will outlive it.

## Change Sizing

Small, focused changes are easier to review, faster to merge, and safer to deploy. Target these sizes:

```
~100 lines changed   → Good. Reviewable in one sitting.
~300 lines changed   → Acceptable if it's a single logical change.
~1000 lines changed  → Too large. Split it.
```

**What counts as "one change":** A single self-contained modification that addresses one thing, includes related tests, and keeps the system functional after submission. One part of a feature — not the whole feature.

**Splitting strategies when a change is too large:**

| Strategy | How | When |
|----------|-----|------|
| **Stack** | Submit a small change, start the next one based on it | Sequential dependencies |
| **By file group** | Separate changes for groups needing different reviewers | Cross-cutting concerns |
| **Horizontal** | Create shared code/stubs first, then consumers | Layered architecture |
| **Vertical** | Break into smaller full-stack slices of the feature | Feature work |

**When large changes are acceptable:** Complete file deletions and automated refactoring where the reviewer only needs to verify intent, not every line.

**Separate refactoring from feature work.** A change that refactors existing code and adds new behavior is two changes — submit them separately. Small cleanups (variable renaming) can be included at reviewer discretion.

## Change Descriptions

Every change needs a description that stands alone in version control history.

**First line:** Short, imperative, standalone. "Delete the FizzBuzz RPC" not "Deleting the FizzBuzz RPC." Must be informative enough that someone searching history can understand the change without reading the diff.

**Body:** What is changing and why. Include context, decisions, and reasoning not visible in the code itself. Link to bug numbers, benchmark results, or design docs where relevant. Acknowledge approach shortcomings when they exist.

**Anti-patterns:** "Fix bug," "Fix build," "Add patch," "Moving code from A to B," "Phase 1," "Add convenience functions."
